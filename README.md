# BANKING SYSTEM

# This is a basic Python program that simulates an online banking system.
# It includes essential features like account creation, login, balance checking,
# transferring money, withdrawing funds, and account deletion.
# User data is stored in a CSV file (username, password, and balance), 
# which acts like a mini database for our application.

# Why I Made This:
# I built this project to practice and demonstrate some key programming concepts in Python:
# - File Handling: The program uses CSV files to save and retrieve user data, 
#   simulating how a database works behind the scenes.
# - User Authentication: Users can log in with a username and password, with the program 
#   checking their credentials, similar to a real-life login system.
# - Transaction Handling: Users can withdraw or transfer funds from their accounts, and 
#   the program checks for sufficient balances, updates the CSV file, and displays the new balance.
# - User Interface: The program provides a simple menu that allows users to interact with 
#   the system and make decisions like logging in, checking balances, or exiting.

# Overall, this was a chance to apply what I've learned about Python in a real-world context,
# combining various skills like user input handling, loops, file operations, and time delays 
# for a more interactive experience. While it's still basic, it lays the foundation for 
# understanding more advanced concepts like security, error handling, and object-oriented design.
